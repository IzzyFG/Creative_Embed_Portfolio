# Creative Embedded Projects

This repo is intended as a portfolio for my work in Barnard COMS 3930 Creative 
Embedded Systems class. This class focused on using microcontrollers 
(specifically TTGO T1) to create artistic pieces.


## [Project 1: Words and More Words](./installation_1)

This project was intended as an introduction to microcontrollers, Arduino IDE
and embedded systems/design. I decided to display on the microcontroller the most
commonly used words in the English Language in a randomized order with the font
size representing the frequency of use (i.e. the larger the word the more often 
it used). 

## [Project 2: Quiz Project](./project_2)

This project in addition to utilizing the TTGO T1 used a joy-stick and button.
I took advantage of the fact web-browsers can listen for serial input on ports
using javascript and created a 
[basic website](./project_2/Quiz_Game/webpage/)
to display the input. With limited ability to create larger scenes in HTML/JS I decided to 
create a simple quiz/trivia game that the user can choose from 1 of 4 topics for.
