# Creative Embedded Projects

This repo is intended as a portfolio for my work in Barnard COMS 3930 Creative 
Embedded Systems class. This class focused on using microcontrollers 
(specifically TTGO T1) to create artistic pieces.

## [Project 1: Words and More Words](./installation_1)

This project was intended as an introduction to microcontrollers, Arduino IDE
and embedded systems/design. I decided to display on the microcontroller the
most commonly used words in the English Language in a randomized order with the
font size representing the frequency of use (i.e. the larger the word the more
often it used).

## [Project 2: Quiz Project](./project_2)

This project in addition to utilizing the TTGO T1 used a joy-stick and button.
I took advantage of the fact web-browsers can listen for serial input on ports
using javascript and created a
[basic website](./project_2/Quiz_Game/webpage/)
to display the input. With limited ability to create larger scenes in HTML/JS I decided to
create a simple quiz/trivia game that the user can choose from 1 of 4 topics
for.

## [Final Project: Tug of Rope](./final_proj)

This project was inspiried by the Rock-em-sock-em kids game. Rock-em-sock-em has
so many moving pieces, I thought it would be impractical to create a motorized
version of it. Instead I wanted to build something with the same amount of
drama it represented. At summer camp we would have a camp wide tournament at the
end of the summer with one of the main activities being a Tug-Of-War game.
It was one of my favorite activities and to us it had the same amount of drama
and tension as a WWE fight, if not more. It meant winning or losing the entire
summer. Using motors, buttons, and gears to "pull" the string towards a player,
to win the game.
